Tasks must be performed using queries or LINQ methods. Cycles are possible
use only when outputting query results.
Basic types collection elements and the collections themselves (lists or arrays) must be described and initialized separately
class. The solution of each task should be contained in a separate method (TaskA, TaskB, TaskC). Parameters
methods should be determined based on the condition of the tasks.
When performing tasks, each of the two options must be used at least once syntax (queries and methods).
It is necessary to test all completed tasks using unit-tests.
Each of the collections must contain at least 20 items.

TASK:
Elements of the collection "Goods" have the following structure: product code, product name, number of units
goods, the selling price of units of goods (codes are unique, may lead to re-connection). Elements
"Supplies" collection can indicate the product code, date, name of delivery, volume of deliveries, price for
unit.
a) Print the average volume of delivery of goods with a given code, tested in the second half
last year.
b) List the suppliers who delivered the product with the specified name for the lowest price.
c) To deduce on each available name of the goods possible profit from its realization.
